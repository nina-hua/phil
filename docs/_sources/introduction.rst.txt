What is Phil?
================================
Traveling in a group can be a fun yet daunting task. Our mission is to help users achieve
stress-free group travel. Our members will be able to interact with recommended itineraries, and store, as well
as split costs from, travel receipts, in addition to the ability to communicate with each other.
Information about the userâ€™s ideal trip will be collected via input solicited from the user within the
web application. Phil will be a platform ideal for traveling groups because of the convenience in
hosting trip expenses, communication, and providing ideas for exploration and group input, thus
taking the burden of planning off of a single person.
